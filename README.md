# Customer Segmentation using K-Means & Hierarchical Clustering

## 📌 Overview
This project performs customer segmentation using unsupervised machine learning techniques.
Customers are grouped based on their income and spending behavior to enable data-driven
marketing and business decision-making.

## 🧠 Techniques Used
- K-Means Clustering
- Agglomerative (Hierarchical) Clustering
- Feature Scaling (StandardScaler)
- Data Visualization

## 📊 Dataset
Mall Customers Dataset containing:
- Age
- Annual Income
- Spending Score

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-link>
Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt


Open Jupyter Notebook

jupyter notebook


Run customer_segmentation.ipynb

📈 Results

The model successfully segments customers into distinct groups, helping identify:

High-value customers

Price-sensitive customers

Low-engagement customers

🔮 Future Improvements
